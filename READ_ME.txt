controls:
forward - W
left - a 
right d
back - s
jump - space

problems accounted for: 
- trouble with script for scene changing start to main level
- jumps needs to be limited
- player doesn't move with moving platform
- need to set a collider so when block is touched by player, 
it changes to a new game over scene or new level.
- no sound

possible improvments:
- new difficult levels with more moving platforms and different obstacles
- coins to keep a score
- lives to skip to a game over screen
- sound
- better player model
- improved level placement
